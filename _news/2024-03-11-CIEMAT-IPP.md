From March 09, I am staying in Madrid, Spain to visit TJ-II a stellarator device of CIEMAT and to find a new chance to collaborate with CIEMAT. During this stay, we shall try to fix the sample size to prepare, find way to install and manipulate into the main vessel of TJ-II, plasma conditions to irradiate with, and diagnostic.

After visiting CIEMAT, I will move to Greifswald, Germany to meet colleagues who have been continuing collaboration over 5 years, and provide new samples to be installed in the W7-X sample manipulator. Our samples will be exposed to W7-X plasmas during next operational campaign.
