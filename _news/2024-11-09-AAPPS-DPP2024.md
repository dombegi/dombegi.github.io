The 8th Annual Conference of the Division of Plasma Physics of the Association of Asia Pacific Physics Society (AAPPS-DPP2024) was held in Malacca, Malaysia on 4-8 November 2024. I gave an invited talk about the in-vessel arc traces investigation of two stellarators Wendelstein 7-X and Large Helical Device, in collaboration with IPP Greifswald (Germany) and NIFS (Japan).
